# Brain-Tumor-Diagnosis-and-DetectionðŸ•µ

## Abstract:
Brain tumors vary in their position, mass, nature, and consistency of these lesions. Due to the similarities found between brain lesions and normal tissues, many challenges are faced by the researcher in developing algorithms for tumor segmentation. Brain tumor abstraction is thought-provoking job in medical image handing out because brain image and its structure is complicated.

Optical imaging and artificial intelligence are making brain tumor diagnosis quicker and more accurate.

This Project aim for providing the **Baseline TUMOR detection and classification model using MASK-RCNN(detection) and DEEP LEAARNING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES**.
